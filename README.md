# Subset-Shrinkage-and-Dimension-Reduction
Find alternative fitting approaches to the normal linear models besides the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). OLS is ideal when the underlying relationship is Linear and we have n>>p. But if n is not much larger than p or p>n, there can be a lot of variability in the fit which can result in either overfitting and very poor predictive ability.  By **constraining** or **shrinking** the estimated coefficients, we can sucessfully reduce the variance associated with the model with a little increase in bias which improves the predictive accuracy.
